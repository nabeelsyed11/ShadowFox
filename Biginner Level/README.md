# 🖼️ CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNN  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **image classification** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
The model is trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which contains **60,000 color images** (32×32 pixels) in **10 different classes**.  

It is a **beginner-friendly deep learning project** that helps understand how CNNs work for computer vision tasks.

## 🧠 Model Architecture  
The CNN model is built using the **Keras Functional API**:  

1. **Input Layer:** Shape (32, 32, 3)  
2. **Conv Block 1:**  
   - Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm  
   - Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm  
   - MaxPooling2D (2×2)  
   - Dropout (0.2)  

3. **Conv Block 2:**  
   - Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm  
   - Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3, ReLU) → BatchNorm  
   - MaxPooling2D (2×2)  
   - Dropout (0.2)  

4. **Fully Connected Layers:**  
   - Flatten  
   - Dense (1024 neurons, ReLU) → Dropout (0.2)  
   - Dense (10 neurons, Softmax) → Output
