# GPT2 Project

A small project demonstrating the use of GPT‑2 (via a Jupyter notebook and a Flask-based app).

## Overview

This project includes:

- `LLM_Project.ipynb`: An exploratory Jupyter notebook showcasing how to load and use GPT‑2 (e.g., text generation, fine-tuning visuals).
- `app.py`: A simple web application (likely using Flask) that serves a UI for interacting with the GPT‑2 model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the necessary Python packages.

## Features

- Load and test GPT‑2 model interactively in a notebook.
- Deploy a local web app for easier usage and experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nabeelsyed11/GPT2.git
cd GPT2
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### 1. Notebook Workflow

Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook LLM_Project.ipynb
```

Run through the cells to see GPT‑2 in action (e.g., text generation, analysis).

#### 2. Web App

Start the app:

```bash
python app.py
```
