# Loan Prediction Project  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project predicts **loan approvals** using machine learning techniques.  
It covers the complete ML workflow including:  
- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Comparison of different algorithms  

This project was developed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at ShadowFox**.

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset contains details of loan applicants and whether their loans were approved.  

### Key Features:  
- **Gender** – Male/Female  
- **Married** – Applicant marital status  
- **Education** – Graduate/Not Graduate  
- **ApplicantIncome** – Income of the applicant  
- **LoanAmount** – Loan amount requested  
- **Credit_History** – Credit history status (1 = good, 0 = bad)  
- **Property_Area** – Rural, Semiurban, Urban  
- **Loan_Status** – Target variable (Y = Approved, N = Not Approved)
